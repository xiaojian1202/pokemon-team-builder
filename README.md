# Pokemon Team Analytics Platform 📈

A data-driven, full-stack application for competitive Pokémon team building, analytics, and optimization.

**Project Status:** In Development 🏗️

---

> **Note:** This project is being built to demonstrate a complete, end-to-end understanding of full-stack development, data engineering, and system architecture.

## 🚀 The Mission

In the world of competitive Pokémon, team building is everything. However, it's often a process of guesswork, trial-and-error, and sifting through forums.

**Project Silph Co.** solves this. It's a "pro-level" tool that empowers players to build teams using **hard data**, not just intuition. It provides an all-in-one platform to build a team, get *instant* statistical feedback, and see how your team stacks up against the current metagame.

## ✨ Core Features

* **Full-Stack Team Builder:** Create, customize (moves, items, abilities), and save your 6-Pokémon teams to your personal account.
* **Live Analytics Engine:** Get *instant* feedback on your team's collective type-weaknesses and resistances as you build.
* **Data-Driven Suggestions:** See the most popular moves, items, and abilities for each Pokémon, scraped directly from the competitive metagame.
* **Secure User Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for a secure, stateless authentication system to manage user accounts and saved teams.
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** All competitive data is automatically scraped and refreshed daily via a GitHub Action, so the insights are *never* stale.
